# Sublime-Twee

Inspired by the work of [monospace](https://github.com/monospaced/sublime-twee), I made a better version of the file used by Sublime Text to color Twee's syntax.

## Install

For the moment you have to manually place these [files](Files) into your Packages folder (Preferences > Browse Packagesâ€¦). 
I have only tried it with Monokai color scheme, there's still room for improvement.


## Key Bindings

If you wish to have the `<<` match with the `>>` as you type, add [this](Files/Key Bindings) to yours (Preferences > Key Bindings)
